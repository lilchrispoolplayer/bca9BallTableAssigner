If there are BYE teams in your session, the team name for them must start with "BYE" followed by a number to uniquely identify them.  For example, if a session had 2 BYE teams they would be labeled BYE1 and BYE2.  Any teams playing a BYE team will be set to the right most column(s) of the assignment tables.
